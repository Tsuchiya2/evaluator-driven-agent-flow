# EDAF Evaluation Skill

## Overview

This skill provides reusable evaluation patterns and scoring frameworks for the EDAF (Evaluator-Driven Agent Flow) system.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- Evaluating code quality, security, performance, or maintainability
- Scoring design documents or task plans
- Generating evaluation reports with consistent formatting
- Applying the EDAF 10-point scoring system

## Capabilities

1. **Scoring Framework**: Consistent 10-point scale (0.0-10.0) with pass threshold of 7.0
2. **Evaluation Patterns**: Reusable criteria for different evaluation types
3. **Report Generation**: Standardized markdown report templates
4. **Issue Classification**: Categorization by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
